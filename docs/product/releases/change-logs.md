A **changelog** is a structured, chronological record of every notable modification made to a product. Its purpose is to document the evolution of the system with precision: what was added, changed, fixed, deprecated, or removed. This level of detail helps technical leaders and engineering teams assess upgrade impact, understand compatibility considerations, and maintain confidence in the stability and trajectory of the platform.

A well-maintained changelog typically:

- Uses a predictable format and consistent categories (e.g. Added, Changed, Fixed, Security).
- Lists entries in version order, newest first.
- Minimises narrative and avoids promotional wording.
- Serves as a source of truth for anyone integrating, auditing, or supporting the system.

## Changelogs vs Release Notes

Although related, the two are not interchangeable.

### **Changelogs**
- Focus on *facts*: exactly what changed.
- Include low-level details such as dependency updates, configuration adjustments, API modifications, and bug resolutions.
- Provide completeness rather than emphasis.
- Are intended for readers who need technical certainty and traceability.

### **Release Notes**
- Focus on *context*: why the release matters.
- Highlight major features, improvements, fixes, and any noteworthy behavioural shifts.
- May include upgrade guidance, caveats, known issues, or strategic framing.
- Are curated rather than exhaustive; they present what matters most for adoption.

## Summary

- A **changelog** is the authoritative technical record of all changes.
- **Release notes** are a selective, narrative-oriented communication layer tailored to help teams understand the significance and practical implications of a release.
- The two complement each other: one ensures accuracy and transparency, the other ensures clarity and effective decision-making.
