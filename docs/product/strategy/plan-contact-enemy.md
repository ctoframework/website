### “No plan survives first contact with the enemy”

This phrase, originally from the military strategist Helmuth von Moltke, means that even the most carefully prepared strategies will almost certainly need to change once reality begins to unfold. Plans are built on assumptions. The moment they’re executed, those assumptions collide with real-world conditions, unforeseen variables, and human factors.

In a business or technology context, this highlights three important principles:

1. **Assumptions Are Fragile**  
   Plans are based on what is known at the time. As soon as execution starts, new information emerges—user behaviour, market shifts, technical constraints—that can undermine initial assumptions.

2. **Adaptability Over Rigidity**  
   The value of a plan lies not in following it blindly, but in using it as a framework for rapid decision-making. Teams that can pivot, iterate, and reallocate resources outperform those that cling to the original blueprint.

3. **Feedback Loops Are Critical**  
   Continuous feedback from real-world signals allows for timely course correction. Short cycles of action and reflection—rather than long, monolithic phases—ensure plans remain relevant.

In short, planning is essential, but flexibility is vital. The ability to absorb new realities and adjust strategy quickly determines success more than the perfection of the initial plan.
