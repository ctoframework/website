## Product

A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) needs a deep and broad understanding of a company's products, technology, and market to drive innovation and strategic growth. Their knowledge of the product should cover the following areas:

- Technical Understanding of the Product
- Product Development Lifecycle
- User Experience & Customer Needs
- Business & Market Strategy
- Collaboration & Leadership

A great CTO doesn't just know the technology, they understand how the product solves problems, fits into the market, and supports the company's vision.
