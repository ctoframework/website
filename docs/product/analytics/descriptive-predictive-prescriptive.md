# Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics

Organizations harness data to gain insights, optimize operations, and drive strategy. Among the various analytics approaches, three stand out as fundamental pillars: **Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics**. Each serves a distinct role in the data-driven decision-making process.

### **1. Descriptive Analytics â€“ Understanding the Past**

Descriptive analytics answers the question: **What happened?** It focuses on summarizing historical data to identify trends and patterns. This is the foundation of data-driven decision-making, providing a clear view of past performance.

ðŸ”¹ **Use Cases:**

- Reporting on revenue trends over the past year.
- Monitoring website traffic patterns.
- Tracking product performance across different markets.

ðŸ”¹ **Techniques & Tools:**

- Dashboards & BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
- Data aggregation & visualization.
- Statistical summaries & historical reporting.

By organizing raw data into digestible insights, descriptive analytics sets the stage for deeper analysis.

### **2. Predictive Analytics â€“ Forecasting the Future**

Predictive analytics addresses the question: **What is likely to happen?** It builds on historical data to make informed forecasts about future trends and events.

ðŸ”¹ **Use Cases:**

- Forecasting next quarterâ€™s sales based on past performance.
- Identifying customers likely to churn.
- Predicting demand fluctuations in supply chains.

ðŸ”¹ **Techniques & Tools:**

- Machine learning models (e.g., regression, decision trees, neural networks).
- Time-series forecasting.
- Statistical modeling and pattern recognition.

While not infallible, predictive analytics provides probabilities that help businesses anticipate challenges and opportunities.

### **3. Prescriptive Analytics â€“ Recommending Actions**

Prescriptive analytics answers the question: **What should be done?** It takes predictive insights a step further by recommending specific actions to optimize outcomes.

ðŸ”¹ **Use Cases:**
