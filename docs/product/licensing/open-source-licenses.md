# Open Source Licenses

Open source licenses determine how software can be used, modified, and shared. Understanding them is crucial for making strategic decisions about technology adoption, compliance, and intellectual property management.

## Key Types of Open Source Licenses

### 1. Permissive Licenses

- Allow broad use with minimal restrictions.
- **Examples**: MIT, Apache 2.0, and BSD.
- Typically, these licenses require attribution but let users incorporate the software into proprietary projects without needing to open-source their modifications.
- **Apache 2.0** includes an explicit patent grant, offering additional legal protection.

### 2. Copyleft Licenses

- Require derivative works to be distributed under the same license.
- **Examples**: GPL, LGPL, and AGPL.
- **GPL (General Public License)** mandates that if software is modified and distributed, the source code must also be made available under GPL.
- **LGPL (Lesser GPL)** is more permissive, allowing dynamic linking with proprietary code.
- **AGPL (Affero GPL)** extends GPL to software provided over a network, requiring hosted services to share their modifications.

### 3. Source-Available Licenses

- Not strictly open source but allow access to the code with additional conditions.
- **Examples**: Elastic License, SSPL (Server Side Public License).
- These are often used to prevent cloud providers from monetizing software without contributing back.

## Considerations When Choosing Open Source Software

- **Legal & Compliance Risks**: Ensure software licenses align with business goals and donâ€™t introduce unwanted obligations.
- **Integration with Proprietary Code**: Permissive licenses are often easier to work with in commercial environments.
- **Contributing Back**: Using copyleft software may require sharing improvements, which can be a strategic decision.
- **Patents & Liability**: Apache 2.0 provides a patent license, while GPL does not, which may impact risk assessments.

A strong open-source strategy balances innovation, compliance, and business objectives. Understanding these licenses ensures smooth adoption, risk management, and long-term sustainability.
