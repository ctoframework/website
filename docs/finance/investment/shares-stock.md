# Shares & Stocks

Shares (or stocks) represent ownership in a company. When a business is divided into shares, each share is a fractional piece of ownership. Public companies sell shares on stock exchanges, while private companies issue shares that are typically held by founders, employees, and investors.

### Equity

Equity refers to the total ownership value in a company. If a company is worth £10 million and an individual owns 10% of it, their equity stake is worth £1 million (on paper).

### Vesting

Vesting is a process where ownership rights to shares (typically granted to employees or founders) are earned over time. A common structure is a **4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff**, meaning:

- No shares are owned if the person leaves before the first year (cliff).
- After the first year, 25% of the shares vest.
- The remaining shares vest monthly or quarterly over the next three years.

This encourages long-term commitment.

### Phantom Shares (Phantom Stock)

These are **not real shares** but rather a promise of a financial payout that mimics stock ownership. They allow participants to benefit from a company’s success (e.g., via cash bonuses tied to share value) without actually owning equity. This is useful in cases where actual stock issuance is complex or undesirable.

### Options vs. RSUs

- **Stock Options**: The right to buy shares at a set price (the "strike price"). If the company grows, the difference between the strike price and the current valuation is the profit.
- **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**: Actual shares granted outright after vesting, usually with no purchase requirement. RSUs are common in public companies.

### Dilution

When a company raises more investment, new shares are created, which **dilutes** (reduces) the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. If someone owns 10% of a company and new shares are issued, their percentage decreases unless they purchase more shares.

### Exit Strategies

- **Acquisition**: The company is bought by another business. Shareholders get paid based on their equity.
- **IPO (Initial Public Offering)**: The company goes public, allowing shareholders to sell shares on the open market.
- **Secondary Sales**: Private sales of shares before an IPO or acquisition, usually to investors or other employees.
