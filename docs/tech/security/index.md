# Security

A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) must have strong security knowledge to protect the company's products, infrastructure, and customer data. While a CTO may not handle security directly, they need to ensure best practices, compliance, and risk management are in place. Here are the key areas of security knowledge a CTO should have:

- Security Fundamentals
- Application Security (AppSec)
- Infrastructure & Cloud Security
- Compliance & Regulatory Standards
- Threat Detection & Incident Response
- DevSecOps & Automation
- Cybersecurity Risk Management

A great CTO ensures security is a priority at all levelsâ€”from product design to cloud infrastructure, protecting the company from cyber threats while enabling business growth.
