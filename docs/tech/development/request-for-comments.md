# Understanding Internal RFCs in a Company Setting

An internal Request for Comments (RFC) is a structured proposal document used within organisations to facilitate thoughtful decision-making on technical or architectural changes. While inspired by the IETF RFC process, internal RFCs are adapted to suit a company's specific culture, workflows, and pace of iteration.

## Purpose

Internal RFCs serve several key functions:

- **Communication**: They enable clear articulation of complex ideas or changes, ensuring all relevant stakeholders are aligned on intent and implications.
- **Transparency**: By documenting proposed changes in a central, reviewable format, RFCs promote visibility across teams and avoid siloed decision-making.
- **Consensus Building**: RFCs allow feedback from multiple perspectives, often leading to better-informed, more robust solutions.
- **Documentation**: Once finalised, RFCs become a permanent part of the technical record, useful for onboarding, audits, and future iterations.

## Typical Structure

A company RFC generally includes the following elements:

- **Title and Summary**: A clear, concise overview of what the RFC proposes.
- **Motivation**: The problem statement and rationale behind the proposal.
- **Proposal**: Detailed explanation of the suggested solution, including diagrams, data models, and pseudocode if needed.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Brief evaluation of other approaches and reasons for rejection.
- **Impact Assessment**: Technical, operational, and organisational implications, including migration paths and risks.
- **Reviewers and Approvals**: A list of contributors and stakeholders who need to review or sign off.

## Process

The RFC process typically follows these stages:

1. **Drafting**: An engineer, architect, or team authors a draft based on an identified need.
2. **Circulation**: The draft is shared for feedback â€” often via version-controlled documents or internal platforms like Confluence or Git repositories.
3. **Review and Iteration**: Feedback is collected and revisions are made collaboratively.
4. **Approval**: Once consensus is reached, the RFC is accepted and scheduled for implementation, or shelved with rationale.
5. **Archival**: The finalised RFC is archived for future reference.

## Benefits

When embedded effectively into a company's culture, RFCs drive better technical outcomes by encouraging deliberate design, collective ownership, and institutional memory. They are particularly valuable in distributed or fast-scaling environments, where alignment and clarity become more challenging.
