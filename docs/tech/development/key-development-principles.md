# Key Software Development Principles

When writing code, following established principles helps ensure maintainability, readability, and efficiency. Below are three fundamental principles every developer should know:

| Principle | Expansion               | Meaning                                                                   | Why It Matters                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **KISS**  | Keep It Simple, Stupid  | Keep code and design as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity. | Simpler code is easier to read, maintain, and debug.                           |
| **DRY**   | Don't Repeat Yourself   | Avoid code duplication by reusing functions, modules, or abstractions.    | Reduces redundancy, minimizes bugs, and makes updates easier.                  |
| **YAGNI** | You Ain’t Gonna Need It | Don’t add features or functionality unless they are required.             | Prevents wasted effort, keeps the codebase lean, and improves maintainability. |
