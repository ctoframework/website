# Tech Radar: A Strategic Framework for Technology Evaluation

A **Tech Radar** is a visual and strategic framework used to capture, evaluate, and communicate the evolving landscape of technologies within an organisation. It supports continuous technology assessment and fosters a deliberate, transparent approach to innovation and adoption.

## Radar Rings

The radar is typically divided into **four rings**, each indicating the recommended level of adoption:

1. **Adopt** – Technologies that are stable, well understood, and have delivered value in real-world use. These are strongly recommended for broad implementation.
2. **Trial** – Technologies that are mature enough for controlled use in projects. These should be explored more widely, especially in domains where they offer clear benefits.
3. **Assess** – Technologies that are promising but unproven or unfamiliar. These warrant research, proof-of-concept work, or limited pilots to evaluate their potential.
4. **Hold** – Technologies that are not recommended for new development efforts. These may be obsolete, misaligned with strategic goals, or have shown significant limitations.

## Radar Quadrants

The radar is further divided into **quadrants**, which typically represent categories such as:

- **Techniques** – Processes or methods, e.g., Continuous Delivery or Chaos Engineering.
- **Tools** – Software applications or libraries used in development and operations.
- **Platforms** – Foundational technologies such as cloud providers, container orchestrators, or operating systems.
- **Languages & Frameworks** – Programming languages, frameworks, or SDKs used to build applications.

## Benefits

By periodically reviewing and updating the Tech Radar, organisations maintain a **living document** that reflects real-world usage, lessons learned, and strategic intent. Key benefits include:

- Encouraging knowledge sharing across teams
- Reducing redundant evaluations
- Providing a coherent picture of the technology landscape
- Supporting a culture of deliberate innovation
- Helping manage technical risk
- Enabling alignment across engineering and product functions
