# REST APIs

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized architectural style for designing networked applications. It provides a scalable, flexible, and lightweight way for different software systems to communicate over HTTP.

## Key Principles of REST APIs

1. **Statelessness** – Each request from a client to the server must contain all necessary information. The server does not store client state between requests, improving scalability.
2. **Client-Server Separation** – The frontend (client) and backend (server) are decoupled, allowing independent evolution of both.
3. **Uniform Interface** – APIs follow standard conventions, typically using HTTP methods like:
   - `GET` for retrieving data
   - `POST` for creating resources
   - `PUT/PATCH` for updating resources
   - `DELETE` for removing resources
4. **Resource-Based** – Everything is treated as a resource, identified by unique URIs (e.g., `/users/123` represents a specific user).
5. **Cacheability** – Responses can be cached to improve performance and reduce server load.
6. **Layered System** – The architecture can have multiple layers (e.g., load balancers, security layers) without impacting the client.

## Benefits

- **Scalability** – Stateless design and caching enable horizontal scaling.
- **Interoperability** – REST APIs use standard protocols (JSON, XML) and can be consumed by various clients (web, mobile, third-party apps).
- **Ease of Integration** – Well-documented APIs facilitate seamless third-party integrations.
- **Security & Performance** – Authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, API keys) and optimizations like pagination and compression enhance efficiency.

## Common Challenges & Considerations

- **Versioning** – Managing API versions (`v1`, `v2`) to avoid breaking changes.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling** – Preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.
- **Monitoring & Observability** – Logging, analytics, and tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) for tracking performance and debugging.

REST APIs remain a foundational approach for modern distributed applications, though alternatives like GraphQL and gRPC are also gaining traction in certain scenarios.
