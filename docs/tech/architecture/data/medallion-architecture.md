# Medallion Architecture

The **Medallion Architecture** is a structured approach to organising data in a **lakehouse** by layering it into distinct tiers: **Bronze, Silver, and Gold**. This framework improves data quality, governance, and performance for analytical and machine learning workloads.

## **Key Layers in the Medallion Architecture**

### 1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**

- Stores raw, ingested data from various sources (databases, logs, APIs, IoT devices).
- Maintains fidelity, including duplicates, missing values, and unstructured formats.
- Used for historical tracking, compliance, and replayability.

### 2. **Silver Layer (Cleansed & Enriched Data)**

- Applies transformations like deduplication, schema enforcement, and error correction.
- Standardises formats for easier querying and integration.
- Acts as a reliable **single source of truth** for operational analytics.

### 3. **Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)**

- Contains aggregated, curated datasets optimised for reporting and machine learning.
- Tailored for end-user consumption in dashboards, AI models, and decision-making.
- Often structured in a **star schema** or **denormalised format** for performance.

## **Why Use the Medallion Architecture?**

- **Improved Data Governance** – Ensures clean, well-managed data with lineage tracking.
- **Scalability & Flexibility** – Supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale.
- **Performance Optimisation** – Reduces computational overhead by staging transformations.
- **Enhances Analytics & AI** – Delivers high-quality data for BI, AI/ML, and real-time use cases.

## **Technology Alignment**

The architecture is commonly implemented in **lakehouse platforms** like **Databricks, Apache Iceberg, and Delta Lake**, enabling ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel.

By structuring data in progressive layers, organisations can enhance reliability, reduce processing costs, and unlock **faster, more informed decision-making**.
