# Gall's Law Explained

**Gall's Law** states:

> _A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system._

## Key Takeaways

- **Evolution over Design:** Functional complexity emerges through incremental improvement of simpler, working systems. Attempting to create a fully complex system from the outset usually leads to failure.

- **Iterative Development:** Start with a small, functional core and expand. This approach reduces risk, exposes flaws early, and allows for adaptive learning as requirements change.

- **Refinement Through Feedback:** Each stage of evolution provides feedback that informs the next iteration, ensuring the system aligns with real-world conditions and user needs.

## Practical Implications

- **Prototype First:** Build minimal, working versions before scaling. Avoid grand designs that attempt to predict all variables.

- **Favour Modularity:** Architect systems as loosely coupled components. This allows for easier iteration, replacement, and scaling.

- **Expect Change:** Complex systems thrive on adaptability. Plan for continuous integration and improvement rather than perfection from the start.

## Bottom Line

The most reliable path to building robust, complex systems is to begin with something small and functional, then evolve it through iterative cycles of learning, feedback, and refinement.
