# Trust, but verify

The proverb **“trust but verify”** highlights the balance between confidence and caution in decision-making. It suggests that while you should place trust in your team, partners, or systems, you must also independently confirm that expectations are being met.

In practice, this means:

- **Delegation with accountability**: Trust the expertise of others but establish mechanisms—such as audits, reviews, or automated checks—to ensure outcomes align with agreed standards.
- **Risk management**: Trust reduces friction and speeds up collaboration, but verification helps catch errors or misalignment before they escalate.
- **Data-driven oversight**: Rely on metrics, reports, and transparent processes to validate assumptions rather than accepting claims at face value.

This approach fosters a culture where confidence and verification coexist, enabling better decisions, stronger reliability, and reduced exposure to avoidable risks.
