## Janitor putting a man on the moon

!!! quote ""

    In 1962, President John F. Kennedy visited NASA for the first time. During his tour of the facility, he met a janitor who was carrying a broom down the hallway. The President then casually asked the janitor what he did for NASA, and the janitor replied, **"I’m helping put a man on the moon."**

### Key takeaways

1. **Purpose and Vision** – The janitor’s response reflects a deep understanding of NASA’s mission. Even in a seemingly small role, he saw himself as contributing to something greater—putting a man on the moon.

2. **Leadership and Inspiration** – JFK’s leadership was about uniting people behind a bold vision. When leaders articulate a clear and compelling goal, everyone—from astronauts to janitors—can see their role in achieving it.

3. **Workplace Culture and Ownership** – The story highlights the importance of fostering a culture where every team member, regardless of position, feels valued and connected to the organization’s larger purpose.

4. **Mindset Matters** – A sense of purpose and perspective transforms a job into a mission. It’s not just about what we do, but why we do it.
