# Understanding Ikigai: A Framework for Purpose and Impact

**Ikigai** is a Japanese concept meaning _“reason for being”_. It represents the intersection where personal fulfilment meets societal value, offering a structured way to align passion, skill, demand, and sustainability.

At its core, ikigai is the convergence of four overlapping dimensions:

1. **What You Love**  
   The activities and challenges that energise you and provide intrinsic satisfaction.

2. **What You Are Good At**  
   Your expertise, strengths, and unique abilities that set you apart.

3. **What The World Needs**  
   Problems worth solving, market gaps, and opportunities for meaningful change.

4. **What You Can Be Paid For**  
   Economic viability — ensuring that your work is not only impactful but also sustainable.

## The Overlap Zones

- **Passion** = What you love + What you are good at  
  Fulfilment without necessarily addressing external needs.

- **Mission** = What you love + What the world needs  
  Inspiring, but potentially unsustainable if not compensated.

- **Vocation** = What the world needs + What you can be paid for  
  Useful and market-aligned, but not always personally satisfying.

- **Profession** = What you are good at + What you can be paid for  
  Reliable, but may lack deeper meaning.

## The Sweet Spot

The **ikigai** lies at the centre where all four dimensions meet — a state where work delivers personal joy, plays to your strengths, meets real-world demand, and ensures economic stability.

For leaders and decision-makers, applying ikigai thinking can help:

- Prioritise projects that balance passion and market relevance.
- Align team skills with high-impact opportunities.
- Create long-term strategies that sustain both motivation and revenue.

In essence, ikigai is not a static goal, but an evolving alignment between self, market, and mission.
