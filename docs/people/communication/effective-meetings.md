# Effective Meetings for CTOs: Tips and Techniques That Actually Work

As a CTO, your time is one of your most valuable assets – and so is your team's. Meetings, when well-run, can drive alignment, unlock decisions, and foster innovation. When poorly run, they drain productivity and morale.

Here's a distilled playbook for ensuring your meetings create value, not just noise.

---

## 1. Start with the Question: “Do We Need a Meeting?”

Before booking time, ask: _Could this be resolved via Slack, an email thread, or a shared doc?_

- **High-value meetings**: Decision-making, conflict resolution, strategy alignment, knowledge sharing that benefits from live discussion.
- **Low-value meetings**: Status updates that could be written, vague brainstorms with no clear purpose.

---

## 2. Define a Sharp Purpose and Agenda

Your meeting title should be as clear as your meeting purpose.

- **Agenda rule**: One line per topic with an intended outcome (decision, update, brainstorm).
- Share the agenda **at least 24 hours in advance**. This sets expectations and gives participants time to prepare.

---

## 3. Choose the Right People – No Tourists

Invite only those who:

1. Have direct decision-making authority.
2. Will actively contribute.
3. Need the context to execute their work.  
   Everyone else can get a post-meeting summary.

## 4. Timebox Aggressively

- Default to **25 or 50 minutes** to respect focus cycles.
- Assign a timekeeper to flag when discussions overrun.
- If you've finished early, end early. That's a win.

---

## 5. Leverage Pre-Work

For technical or strategic topics, circulate background material in advance.

- Use pre-read decks, architecture diagrams, or briefing docs.
- Expect participants to arrive informed; meetings should be for discussion, not reading aloud.

---

## 6. Drive to Decisions – and Document Them

Nothing erodes trust faster than re-litigating the same issue.

- Explicitly state decisions in the meeting.
- Summarise key actions, owners, and deadlines before leaving.
- Post notes in a shared, searchable space (e.g., Confluence, Notion).

---

## 7. Manage Dynamics Like a Facilitator, Not Just a Participant

- Keep dominant voices in check; actively invite quieter team members to contribute.
- Use “parking lots” for off-topic but valuable tangents.
- Don't let technical deep-dives derail unless that's the purpose of the meeting.

---

## 8. Apply the ‘One Minute Rule' for Follow-Ups

If an action can be assigned or a decision confirmed in under a minute, do it in the meeting. This prevents post-meeting drift.

---

## 9. Use Asynchronous Tools to Reduce Meeting Load

- Weekly async status reports (video or text).
- Collaborative doc reviews.
- Loom walkthroughs for demos.

---

## 10. Review and Prune Recurring Meetings

Once a quarter, audit all recurring meetings:

- Does the purpose still exist?
- Could it move to async?
- Could frequency be reduced?
