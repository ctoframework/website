### **Dunbar’s Number and Team Design**

Dunbar’s Number, proposed by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, suggests that humans can maintain stable social relationships with approximately **150 people**. This concept has significant implications for **organizational and team design**, particularly for a **CTO** managing engineering teams.

### **Key Implications for CTOs and Organizational Design**

#### **1. Limits on Team Size and Communication Overhead**

- Dunbar’s research suggests **different layers of relationship strength**:
  - **5 close relationships (e.g., co-founders, key leadership team)**
  - **15 strong relationships (e.g., direct reports, core product/engineering leads)**
  - **50 meaningful relationships (e.g., key managers and senior engineers)**
  - **150 stable relationships (e.g., wider org, broader team within a business unit)**
- Beyond **150**, relationships become more transactional, leading to increased **bureaucracy, silos, and inefficiencies**.

#### **2. Engineering Team Structure and Scaling**

- **Early-stage startups**: Communication is fluid, and most engineers interact directly with leadership.
- **Growth-stage companies** (~50-150 engineers): The transition from a single engineering team to **multiple teams and units** becomes necessary. CTOs must introduce **clear reporting structures, processes, and communication cadences** to avoid breakdowns.
- **Beyond 150 engineers**: Teams start operating in silos unless there are **deliberate efforts to maintain connectivity**, such as cross-team rituals, documentation, and internal tooling.

#### **3. The Need for Subdivisions and Pods**

- **Spotify Model (Squads, Tribes, Guilds)**: Organizations like Spotify address Dunbar’s Number by **breaking engineering teams into smaller, autonomous units** (e.g., Squads of 6-12, Tribes of ~50).
- **Two-Pizza Teams (Amazon)**: Amazon’s model limits teams to a size that can be fed with two pizzas (~8-10 people), reinforcing **small, high-trust teams**.
- **Conway’s Law**: Team structures influence system architecture. Keeping **bounded teams with clear ownership** helps avoid monolithic dependencies.

#### **4. Leadership and CTO Span of Control**

- A CTO should **not directly manage** more than **5-8 people** (aligning with Dunbar’s inner circle).
- **Engineering managers** can handle **7-10 direct reports** before team cohesion weakens.
- **Beyond ~150 engineers**, a VP of Engineering or other leadership layers become critical to **maintain alignment, communication, and cultural cohesion**.
