# What is an Induction Plan?

An induction plan is a strategic onboarding framework designed to guide new hires through their initial period in an organisation. Its purpose is to ensure that individuals are integrated effectively—both operationally and culturally—so they can contribute with confidence, clarity, and alignment to the organisation’s objectives.

It combines practical onboarding (systems access, compliance, tools training) with cultural immersion and role-specific enablement, delivered over a structured timeline—often across the first 30, 60, and 90 days.

## Key Components

### 1. Organisational Introduction

- **Objective:** Familiarise the new joiner with the company’s mission, vision, structure, and key personnel.
- **Examples:**
  - Day 1 presentation from a senior leader on the company’s history and strategic priorities.
  - Access to a digital organisational chart with department overviews and leadership bios.
  - Welcome video from the CEO or founder.

### 2. Role-Specific Onboarding

- **Objective:** Ensure clarity on responsibilities, success metrics, and short-term objectives.
- **Examples:**
  - A dedicated session with the direct manager to walk through the job description in the context of current team goals.
  - A “first 90-day roadmap” document tailored to the individual’s role, with clear deliverables (e.g., “Shadow customer interviews in Week 2,” or “Deploy first internal tool fix by end of Month 1”).

### 3. Tools, Systems, and Processes

- **Objective:** Equip the individual with access and understanding of operational systems and daily workflows.
- **Examples:**
  - Access to onboarding modules in a learning management system (LMS) for tools like Jira, GitLab, or Confluence.
  - A checklist including account setup for internal systems (e.g., SSO, Slack, Notion, internal dashboards).

### 4. Compliance and Policy Orientation

- **Objective:** Ensure the employee understands legal, ethical, and procedural expectations.
- **Examples:**
  - Completion of mandatory training on data protection (e.g., GDPR), security protocols, or acceptable use policies.
  - Walkthrough of the employee handbook and escalation procedures.

### 5. Cultural and Team Integration

- **Objective:** Help the employee understand informal norms, communication styles, and internal values.
- **Examples:**
  - Assigned “onboarding buddy” from a different team to meet weekly for the first month.
  - Inclusion in informal virtual coffees, team rituals (e.g., weekly retros), or monthly all-hands.

### 6. Feedback and Checkpoints

- **Objective:** Monitor onboarding progress and surface any concerns early.
- **Examples:**
  - 30-day check-in with HR to capture early impressions and challenges.
  - 60-day retrospective with manager to assess whether early goals are being met and if support structures need adjusting.

## Why it Matters

A strong induction plan reduces time-to-productivity, increases employee satisfaction, and directly improves retention. For instance, in high-growth or distributed organisations, the absence of a clear onboarding path often leads to role ambiguity, duplication of work, or early disengagement.

Conversely, providing a structured path—backed by real content, peer support, and leadership visibility—creates early momentum. For example, a new engineering lead who is given contextual access to current technical challenges, team documentation, and stakeholder maps is far more likely to contribute effectively in their first 60 days than one left to self-navigate.
