# "Hire Slow, Fire Fast"

The phrase **"hire slow, fire fast"** encapsulates a disciplined approach to building high-performing teams. It advocates for **rigorous, deliberate hiring**—investing the necessary time to assess not just technical capabilities, but also cultural fit, long-term potential, and alignment with the organisation’s values and mission.

Conversely, **"fire fast"** stresses the importance of acting decisively when someone is clearly a poor fit or consistently underperforming. Delayed decisions in these situations can have cascading effects: they can demoralise strong team members, degrade productivity, and erode trust in leadership.

This principle is not about being ruthless—it's about maintaining a high-performance environment where each individual elevates the team. Thoughtful hiring minimises the need for tough exits, but when problems persist, swift action is critical for the health of the organisation.
