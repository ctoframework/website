## Skip Levels

Skip levels are meetings or interactions where a senior leader connects directly with employees who report to their direct reports, effectively "skipping" a managerial layer. These sessions help bridge communication gaps, provide unfiltered insights from different levels of the organization, and foster transparency.

### Benefits of Skip Levels

By engaging in skip levels, leaders can:

- Gain firsthand knowledge of team challenges, morale, and workflow efficiency.
- Identify emerging talent and potential future leaders.
- Reinforce company culture and strategic vision directly with broader teams.
- Encourage open dialogue and surface concerns that might not reach them through middle management.

### Best Practices for Effective Skip Levels

To be effective, skip-level meetings should:

- Be structured to encourage honest feedback.
- Avoid undermining middle managers.
- Lead to actionable follow-ups that demonstrate value to all involved.
