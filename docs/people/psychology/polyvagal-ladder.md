# Understanding the Polyvagal Ladder

The **Polyvagal Ladder** is a framework developed by Dr. Stephen Porges to explain how the nervous system responds to stress and safety. Itâ€™s based on the **Polyvagal Theory**, which highlights how our autonomic nervous system shifts between states to manage survival and social connection.

## Three Levels of the Polyvagal Ladder

### 1. Ventral Vagal State (Top of the Ladder)

- This is the state of **safety and connection**.
- The body feels calm, grounded, and open to interaction.
- Cognitive functions such as problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration work at their best here.
- Physiological signs: slower heart rate, steady breathing, and relaxed muscles.

### 2. Sympathetic State (Middle of the Ladder)

- This is the state of **mobilisation** (fight or flight).
- Triggered when the nervous system detects potential threat.
- The body prepares for action: increased heart rate, faster breathing, heightened alertness.
- Useful for short-term challenges but unsustainable long-term.

### 3. Dorsal Vagal State (Bottom of the Ladder)

- This is the state of **shutdown or collapse**.
- Triggered when the nervous system perceives overwhelming or inescapable threat.
- The body disengages: low energy, withdrawal, numbness, or even dissociation.
- Designed to conserve energy in extreme circumstances.

## Moving Up and Down the Ladder

- People naturally move between these states throughout the day.
- **Co-regulation** (supportive interactions) and practices like controlled breathing, grounding, and mindfulness can help shift back up the ladder toward safety and connection.
- Recognising where someone is on the ladder can inform how to respond effectively to stress or crisis.

## Why It Matters

- The Polyvagal Ladder shows that our ability to think clearly, relate to others, and perform at our best depends heavily on our physiological state.
- By understanding and supporting nervous system regulation, we create conditions for better decision-making, collaboration, and resilience.
