## Janitor putting a man on the moon

> In 1962, President John F. Kennedy visited NASA for the first time. During his tour of the facility, he met a janitor who was carrying a broom down the hallway. The President then casually asked the janitor what he did for NASA, and the janitor replied, **"Iâ€™m helping put a man on the moon."**
