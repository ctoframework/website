# The Pomodoro Technique

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by **Francesco Cirillo** in the late 1980s. It helps improve focus and productivity by breaking work into short intervals, typically **25 minutes**, followed by a short **5-minute break**. These intervals are called **Pomodoros** (Italian for "tomatoes") because Cirillo originally used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer.

## How the Pomodoro Technique Works

1. **Choose a task** you want to work on.
2. **Set a timer for 25 minutes** and work on the task without distractions.
3. **When the timer rings, stop working** and take a **5-minute break**.
4. **Repeat the cycle** four times (4 Pomodoros).
5. After completing four Pomodoros, take a **longer break of 15–30 minutes**.

## Why It Works

- **Reduces Procrastination**: The short time frame makes tasks feel less daunting.
- **Enhances Focus**: Knowing you have a break soon helps maintain concentration.
- **Prevents Burnout**: Regular breaks prevent mental fatigue.
- **Improves Time Awareness**: Helps track how long tasks take.

## Customizing the Pomodoro Technique

While the standard Pomodoro session is **25 minutes work + 5 minutes break**, you can adjust it to fit your personal workflow, such as:

- **50 minutes work + 10 minutes break** (for deep focus tasks)
- **90 minutes work + 20–30 minutes break** (for extended creative work)
