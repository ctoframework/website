# Team Topologies

**Team Topologies** is a framework for designing and evolving team structures to enhance software delivery and organizational effectiveness. Developed by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais in _Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow_, it provides a model for structuring teams to improve collaboration, reduce cognitive load, and enable faster software delivery.

## Key Concepts of Team Topologies

### 1. Four Fundamental Team Types

The framework defines four types of teams, each with a distinct purpose:

- **Stream-aligned teams** – Aligned to a business domain or value stream, delivering end-to-end value (e.g., a payments team in an e-commerce company).
- **Enabling teams** – Help other teams acquire new skills, tools, and capabilities (e.g., an SRE team teaching reliability practices).
- **Complicated subsystem teams** – Handle specialized, complex domains requiring deep expertise (e.g., teams managing AI algorithms or cryptography).
- **Platform teams** – Provide reusable services, tools, and platforms to support stream-aligned teams (e.g., internal developer platforms).

### 2. Three Core Interaction Modes

How teams interact is crucial to minimizing friction and maximizing efficiency:

- **Collaboration** – Teams work together for a defined period to discover solutions.
- **Facilitating** – Enabling teams guide and mentor other teams without direct involvement.
- **X-as-a-Service** – One team provides services or capabilities that other teams consume independently.

### 3. Cognitive Load Considerations

- Teams should be designed to manage a reasonable amount of cognitive load.
- Avoid overloading teams with too many responsibilities or complex systems.
- Stream-aligned teams should be empowered but not burdened with unrelated concerns (e.g., infrastructure, security, etc.).

### 4. Evolutionary Team Structures

- Teams should adapt as the organization scales and requirements evolve.
- Early-stage companies may need more collaboration, whereas mature organizations benefit from well-defined service boundaries.

## Benefits of Team Topologies

- Faster delivery by reducing dependencies and bottlenecks.
- Improved developer experience and autonomy.
- Better knowledge-sharing and upskilling through enabling teams.
- Scalable team structures that evolve with business needs.
