### Swarming / Mobbing Explained

**Swarming** and **Mobbing** are collaborative techniques used in software development to accelerate problem-solving, knowledge sharing, and delivery quality.

---

#### Swarming

Swarming happens when multiple team members focus collectively on a **single work item**.  
Instead of everyone working independently on different tasks, the team converges on the most important or urgent issue until it is resolved.

- **Goal**: Reduce cycle time by bringing diverse expertise to one task.
- **Example**: A critical bug is discovered in production, and developers, testers, and operations all stop other work to solve it together.

#### Mobbing

Mobbing (or **Mob Programming**) extends the idea of pair programming to the **entire team**.  
All members work on the same piece of code at the same time, typically using one shared workstation or environment.

- **Roles**:
  - **Driver**: The person at the keyboard.
  - **Navigators**: Everyone else, guiding, reviewing, and suggesting approaches.
- **Goal**: Collective code ownership, shared understanding, and higher-quality design.
- **Example**: A team builds a complex new feature together, continuously discussing, designing, and coding in real time.

#### Why It Matters

- **Speed**: Problems are solved faster by pooling knowledge immediately.
- **Quality**: Continuous feedback reduces defects.
- **Learning**: Team members upskill each other naturally.
- **Alignment**: Everyone has the same context, reducing handoff delays.

Both techniques trade off short-term individual productivity for long-term **throughput, resilience, and adaptability**.
