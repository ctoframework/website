# Definition of Ready and Definition of Done

### Definition of Ready (DoR)

The **Definition of Ready** ensures that a user story or task is sufficiently refined before the team begins work. It serves as a checklist to confirm that all necessary details, dependencies, and criteria are in place for efficient execution. Key elements often include:

- Clearly defined business and technical requirements
- Acceptance criteria established
- Dependencies identified and addressed
- Sufficient details for estimation and planning
- No blocking issues preventing progress

A well-formed DoR improves predictability, reduces rework, and enhances team efficiency.

### Definition of Done (DoD)

The **Definition of Done** establishes the criteria a task must meet before it is considered complete. It ensures alignment on quality, completeness, and delivery expectations. A strong DoD typically includes:

- Code written, reviewed, and merged
- Automated and manual tests passed
- Security and performance checks completed
- Documentation updated
- Deployed to the appropriate environment
- Meets business and acceptance criteria

By enforcing a robust DoD, teams maintain quality standards, reduce technical debt, and deliver fully functional increments.
