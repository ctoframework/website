# Definition of Done (DoD)

The **Definition of Done** establishes the criteria a task must meet before it is considered complete. It ensures alignment on quality, completeness, and delivery expectations. A strong DoD typically includes:

- Code written, reviewed, and merged
- Automated and manual tests passed
- Security and performance checks completed
- Documentation updated
- Deployed to the appropriate environment
- Meets business and acceptance criteria

By enforcing a robust DoD, teams maintain quality standards, reduce technical debt, and deliver fully functional increments.
