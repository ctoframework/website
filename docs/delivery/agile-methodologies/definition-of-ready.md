# Definition of Ready (DoR)

The **Definition of Ready** ensures that a user story or task is sufficiently refined before the team begins work. It serves as a checklist to confirm that all necessary details, dependencies, and criteria are in place for efficient execution. Key elements often include:

- Clearly defined business and technical requirements
- Acceptance criteria established
- Dependencies identified and addressed
- Sufficient details for estimation and planning
- No blocking issues preventing progress

A well-formed DoR improves predictability, reduces rework, and enhances team efficiency.
