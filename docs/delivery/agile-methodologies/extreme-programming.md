# Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development methodology designed to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. It emphasizes close collaboration, frequent releases, and continuous feedback to ensure high-quality code and efficient workflows.

## Core Principles of XP

1. **Communication** – Developers work closely with each other and stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings and ensuring alignment.
2. **Simplicity** – The focus is on delivering only what is necessary, reducing complexity and technical debt.
3. **Feedback** – Rapid iterations with continuous testing allow for quick course correction.
4. **Courage** – Developers are encouraged to refactor code, embrace change, and take calculated risks.
5. **Respect** – Teams work collaboratively, valuing each other's input and expertise.

## Key Practices of XP

- **Pair Programming** – Two developers work together on the same code to improve quality and knowledge sharing.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** – Writing tests before writing the actual code ensures reliability and maintainability.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Frequent code integration prevents large, disruptive merges and ensures stability.
- **Frequent Releases** – Small, incremental releases keep the product adaptable and aligned with business needs.
- **Collective Code Ownership** – Everyone on the team is responsible for the entire codebase, reducing bottlenecks.
- **On-Site Customer** – Having a real user or stakeholder involved helps prioritize and clarify requirements.

XP is particularly effective in fast-changing environments where adaptability and high-quality code are critical. It enables teams to deliver functional, well-tested software while embracing evolving requirements.
