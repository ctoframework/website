# Monte Carlo simulations

Monte Carlo methods are a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions in environments with uncertainty. They use random sampling to model possible outcomes and estimate probabilities, helping to assess risks, optimize processes, and forecast performance.

For example, in software delivery, Monte Carlo simulations can predict project timelines by running thousands of simulations based on historical data. Instead of relying on a single estimate, this approach provides a probability distribution of completion dates, offering a realistic view of potential delays.

In financial planning, Monte Carlo can model different cost scenarios, helping to anticipate budget overruns. Similarly, in system reliability, it can simulate failure rates to improve resilience and maintenance strategies.

Leveraging Monte Carlo methods, decision-making becomes less reliant on intuition and more grounded in probabilistic analysis, leading to more predictable and optimized outcomes.

## Concrete Example: Project Delivery Forecast

Imagine a software team wants to predict how long a project will take to complete. Based on historical data:

- The team completes between **5 and 15 tasks per week** (with an average of 10).
- The project has **200 tasks** remaining.

Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we run **10,000 iterations**, each time randomly selecting a completion rate between 5 and 15 tasks per week. The results might look like this:

- **10% chance** of finishing in **13 weeks** (best case).
- **50% chance** (median) of finishing in **17 weeks**.
- **90% chance** of finishing in **22 weeks** (worst-case but likely scenario).

This approach provides a **probabilistic range** instead of a single estimate, allowing for better planning and risk management. It helps answer critical questions like:

- _What is the likelihood of completing within 18 weeks?_
- _How much buffer should we plan for?_
