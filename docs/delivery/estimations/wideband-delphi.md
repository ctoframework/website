# Wideband Delphi: An Overview

Wideband Delphi is a structured, iterative approach to estimation and decision-making that builds on the classic Delphi method. It is commonly used in technology and product development environments to improve the accuracy of forecasts, particularly for complex or uncertain work.

## Core Principles

1. **Expert Consensus**  
   A selected group of subject matter experts individually estimate or evaluate a given problem or task. These estimates are then shared anonymously within the group.

2. **Iteration with Feedback**  
   Participants review the anonymised results, discuss the rationale behind their own and othersâ€™ estimates, and revise their inputs over multiple rounds. This iterative process converges towards a more reliable and defensible estimate.

3. **Anonymity and Reduced Bias**  
   Individual inputs are kept anonymous during the initial rounds to minimise the influence of authority, seniority or groupthink. This encourages more candid opinions and reduces bias.

4. **Structured Facilitation**  
   A facilitator manages the process: defining the scope, ensuring clear instructions, and orchestrating the rounds. This keeps discussions focused and productive.

## Typical Steps

1. **Preparation**  
   Define the scope, objectives, and metrics for estimation. Select the right participants.

2. **Initial Estimates**  
   Each participant independently provides estimates or assessments.

3. **Review and Discussion**  
   Aggregated results are shared. Differences are examined, assumptions clarified, and outliers explained.

4. **Revised Estimates**  
   Participants adjust their estimates based on the new information.

5. **Consolidation**  
   After several rounds, results are consolidated into a final estimate or decision.

## Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy**: Leveraging multiple expert perspectives reduces the risk of overly optimistic or pessimistic forecasts.
- **Shared Understanding**: Group discussions help uncover hidden assumptions and dependencies.
- **Transparency**: The process documents rationales and justifications, creating a defensible audit trail.
- **Flexibility**: Can be applied to effort estimation, risk analysis, prioritisation, or strategic planning.

## Key Takeaways

Wideband Delphi works best when:

- The problem is complex or uncertain.
- Diverse expertise is required.
- Stakeholders want a structured, evidence-based estimate rather than a single opinion.

Its iterative, consensus-driven nature leads to estimates and decisions that are typically more robust and better supported than those produced by traditional top-down methods.
