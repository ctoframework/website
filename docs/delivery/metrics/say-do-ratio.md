# Say-Do Ratio

## **What is the Say-Do Ratio?**

The **say-do ratio** measures the consistency between what is promised or committed to and what is actually delivered. A high say-do ratio indicates reliability and accountability, while a low ratio suggests overpromising, underdelivering, or a misalignment between intentions and execution.

## **Uses of the Say-Do Ratio**

1. **Building Trust** – When teams and stakeholders see that commitments are consistently met, confidence in leadership and execution grows.
2. **Assessing Reliability** – It helps evaluate whether individuals or teams follow through on their commitments, which is critical for operational effectiveness.
3. **Improving Execution Discipline** – Tracking this metric encourages a culture of setting realistic expectations and meeting them.
4. **Aligning Strategy with Delivery** – It provides insight into whether the organization is setting achievable goals or needs to recalibrate its planning process.

## **What It Shouldn’t Be Used For**

1. **Punishing Honest Communication** – If used punitively, it can discourage people from making bold commitments or admitting when challenges arise.
2. **Over-Simplifying Performance Measurement** – A high ratio does not always indicate success; consistently setting low-risk, easily achievable goals can inflate it artificially.
3. **Discouraging Ambition** – Innovation requires some level of risk and experimentation, which naturally leads to some unfulfilled commitments.

Effectively managing the say-do ratio involves balancing ambition with execution while fostering a culture where accountability and adaptability coexist.

## **Say-Do Ratio in Agile & Scrum**

1. **Commitment vs. Delivery in Sprints**

   - In Scrum, teams commit to a Sprint Goal and select work from the backlog. The say-do ratio helps measure how much of that committed work is actually completed within the Sprint.
   - A **high say-do ratio** indicates that the team is making realistic commitments and delivering consistently.
   - A **low ratio** suggests misalignment in planning, unexpected blockers, or overcommitment.

2. **Predictability & Velocity**

   - Agile teams strive for predictable delivery. A stable say-do ratio helps teams refine their **velocity**, making sprint planning more accurate over time.
   - If the ratio fluctuates significantly, it may indicate issues such as:
     - Unclear requirements
     - Scope creep
     - External dependencies
     - Poor estimation techniques

3. **Encouraging a Culture of Realistic Commitments**

   - A strong Agile team doesn’t just commit to **what is possible** but also learns to adjust expectations based on past performance.
   - Tracking the say-do ratio helps teams **self-correct** and foster a culture of accountability without creating fear of failure.

4. **Stakeholder Trust & Transparency**

   - Agile promotes **working software over comprehensive documentation**, but predictability still matters.
   - A team that consistently meets its commitments builds credibility with stakeholders, product owners, and leadership.
   - If commitments frequently go unmet, stakeholders may lose confidence in the team’s ability to deliver.

5. **Continuous Improvement & Retrospectives**
   - The say-do ratio can be an indicator for **Sprint Retrospectives**, helping teams identify process inefficiencies.
   - Instead of just looking at completed vs. committed work, teams should **analyze the "why"** behind any gaps:
     - Were stories too large?
     - Were there unplanned disruptions?
     - Was external dependency management an issue?
   - This insight allows teams to improve estimation and prioritization over time.

## **What the Say-Do Ratio Shouldn’t Be Used For in Agile & Scrum**

1. **Rigid Performance Measurement**

   - Agile is about adaptability. A lower say-do ratio in one sprint doesn’t necessarily indicate failure—it may highlight valuable learning experiences.

2. **Punitive Accountability**

   - If leadership uses the say-do ratio as a **punishment tool**, teams may start gaming the system by committing to **only safe, low-risk work**, stifling innovation.

3. **Micromanagement**
   - A focus on strict adherence to commitments can lead to **micromanagement**, reducing the flexibility that Agile is meant to provide.

---

## **Conclusion**

In Agile and Scrum, the **say-do ratio** is a **guiding metric** rather than a strict performance indicator. It helps teams assess their predictability, refine sprint planning, and build trust with stakeholders. However, it should be used as a tool for **continuous improvement**, not as a rigid KPI that discourages experimentation or learning.
