## Understanding KPIs

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** are measurable values that indicate how effectively an organisation is achieving its strategic objectives. They provide a quantifiable benchmark for success and guide decision-making across different levels of the business.

### Core Characteristics

- **Measurable**: KPIs are expressed in numerical terms, making them trackable and comparable over time.
- **Aligned with Strategy**: They reflect organisational priorities and link directly to business goals.
- **Actionable**: KPIs highlight areas that require attention or adjustment, enabling data-driven action.
- **Time-bound**: They are monitored over specific periods (monthly, quarterly, annually) to evaluate trends and performance.

### Examples of KPIs

- Revenue growth rate
- Customer acquisition cost
- Average resolution time
- System uptime or availability

### Why KPIs Matter

By focusing on KPIs, organisations can:

- Monitor progress towards objectives.
- Identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- Improve accountability across teams.
- Make informed decisions based on data rather than assumptions.

### Best Practice Tips

- Select a limited set of high-impact KPIs rather than tracking everything.
- Ensure KPIs are clearly defined and communicated.
- Regularly review and adjust KPIs as goals evolve.

In essence, KPIs transform strategic goals into measurable outcomes, allowing leaders to steer their organisations with clarity and precision.
