# Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)

**Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)** is a framework for improving organisational processes. It provides a structured approach to performance improvement by guiding teams in developing effective, repeatable, and scalable practices across project management, engineering, and support functions.

CMMI is designed to reduce risks in product, service, and software development by assessing the maturity of an organisation’s processes. It comprises **five maturity levels**:

1. **Initial** – Processes are unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive.
2. **Managed** – Projects are planned, performed, measured, and controlled.
3. **Defined** – Processes are well characterised, understood, and described in standards, procedures, and tools.
4. **Quantitatively Managed** – Processes are controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques.
5. **Optimising** – Focus is on continuous process improvement through incremental and innovative changes.

The model enables benchmarking, helps ensure compliance, and facilitates continuous improvement across complex systems and large-scale development efforts. Adoption of CMMI typically leads to improved delivery predictability, reduced defects, better alignment between business and technical goals, and enhanced capability in handling large or mission-critical projects.

There are multiple constellations of CMMI, such as:

- **CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV)**
- **CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC)**
- **CMMI for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ)**

Each addresses a specific area of organisational focus.

Ultimately, CMMI provides a disciplined environment that supports scalable growth, risk management, and operational excellence.
