# Occam’s Razor

Occam’s Razor, also known as the principle of parsimony, is a problem-solving heuristic that suggests the simplest explanation or solution is usually the best. It advises against introducing unnecessary complexity when a more straightforward approach will suffice. This principle is highly relevant in technology decision-making, where complexity can lead to inefficiencies, increased costs, and long-term maintenance challenges.

## System Design and Architecture

When designing systems, the principle of parsimony helps guide architectural decisions. For instance, if a problem can be solved with a well-documented and widely used framework rather than a custom-built solution, the former is often preferable. While custom solutions may offer more control, they frequently introduce additional development time, maintenance burdens, and potential points of failure. By applying Occam’s Razor, teams can avoid over-engineering and focus on practical, scalable solutions.

## Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution

Similarly, in troubleshooting, starting with the simplest possible explanations—such as misconfigurations, resource limits, or common software bugs—before assuming a complex root cause can significantly reduce time-to-resolution. Many outages and performance issues stem from basic oversights rather than deep systemic failures, so applying the principle of parsimony leads to more efficient problem resolution.

## Strategic Technology Decisions

Occam’s Razor also applies to decision-making in broader technology strategies. Whether choosing between cloud providers, programming languages, or team workflows, simpler approaches often lead to better long-term outcomes. Complex solutions may seem attractive at first, offering more flexibility or theoretical optimizations, but they often come with trade-offs in terms of maintainability, onboarding new team members, and overall agility.
