# Understanding RAID: Risk, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies

The **RAID framework** is a structured method for managing four critical elements of project and programme delivery: **Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies**. It provides clarity, ensures accountability, and helps teams make better-informed decisions.

---

## 1. Risks

- **Definition:** Potential events or situations that could have a negative impact if they occur.
- **Examples:** Security vulnerabilities, delays in a key deliverable, or new regulatory requirements.
- **Management:** Identify, assess probability and impact, assign ownership, and track mitigation plans.

---

## 2. Assumptions

- **Definition:** Conditions accepted as true without immediate proof, which could affect outcomes if invalid.
- **Examples:** Assuming vendor APIs remain stable, or that team capacity will remain constant.
- **Management:** Document clearly, validate over time, and review when circumstances change.

---

## 3. Issues

- **Definition:** Problems that are currently happening and require action.
- **Examples:** A failed system integration, lack of stakeholder alignment, or missed deadlines.
- **Management:** Prioritise, assign ownership, and track to resolution.

---

## 4. Dependencies

- **Definition:** External or internal factors that a project relies on to succeed.
- **Examples:** Delivery from another team, infrastructure readiness, or third-party service availability.
- **Management:** Map dependencies early, identify owners, and monitor progress continuously.

## Why RAID Matters

- Brings transparency and accountability across the organisation.
- Provides a structured approach to track what can go wrong, what is assumed, what is already broken, and what relies on others.
- Enables better forecasting, communication, and decision-making.

## Practical Application

Many teams use a **RAID log** (often a simple spreadsheet or integrated project management tool) to document, monitor, and review these elements regularly. This ensures visibility and alignment across stakeholders, and creates a single source of truth for project health.
